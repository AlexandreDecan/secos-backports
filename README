This repository is the replication package of our study on backported updates. 

The list of dependencies required to execute the scripts is contained in `requirements.txt', and can be installed as usual with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It is strongly advice to create an isolated environment with Python 3.5+ before running this command. 

The scripts are available in the `notebooks/` directory, and are expected to be open and executed with `jupyter`. 
The data required for these notebooks are all provided in this repository. They correspond to "data/X-required.csv.gz" and "data/X-dependents.csv.gz" where X is the name of a package distribution. 

These files were generated by the "data/prepare.py" script. This script requires "data/X-releases.csv.gz" and "data/X-dependencies.csv.gz" that can be generated using "data/convert.py", which in turn requires "data-raw/X-releases.csv.gz" and "data-raw/X-dependencies.csv.gz" from the "data-raw" folder. Report to "data-raw/README" to see how to obtain these files.
